Android Studio code for an app that can remotely control a vehicle via Bluetooth.
An APK has been provided to install the app on an Android phone, although, it should be noted that the MAC address for your Bluetooth module should be manually set within the code where the comment directs; otherwise app will be unable to connect and will just sit in standstill.
